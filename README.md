A repository with a very basic code to display the motion of a car from an outside perpective as it moves along a road. 

The code implements the movement of abstract light poles (along both sides of the road) towards the car to give an illusion of the car moving forward. The code includes three test cases - a straight road, and right and left turns appearing at the end of the road.
